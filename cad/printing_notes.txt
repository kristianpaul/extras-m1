We use desktop publishing software Scribus to design the box
artwork and labels (file extension: .sla).
Please install Scribus 1.4.

We will attempt to make the Scribus files as print-ready as
possible, including CMYK color information, and documentation
on how to create the final PDF file for printing.



--- box_artwork_base.sla

box.dxf is the outline used for the box die-cutting. Import into
Inkscape - note that you need to uncheck 'Use automatic scaling to
size A4' and a scaling factor of 1.0. Then save as a temporary
.svg file which can then be imported into Scribus to form the
initial outline for box_artwork_base.sla.

box_artwork_base.sla is the start point of creating a new fresh
artwork for Milkymist One box. It is created by imorting the .svg
file refered above in Scribus.

Steps to create box_artwork_base.sla

** Launch Scribus or if scribus is already launched, go to File -> New
** In New Document window
   * Set Default Unit to 'Millimeters (mm)'
   * Size choose 'Custom'. Width set to '905.000 mm', Height to '684.000 mm'
   * In Margin Guides - Preset Layouts, set all for sides to '15.000 mm'
   * Hit OK button.
** File -> Import -> Get Vector File...
** Select created temp .svg file refered above.
** When file is imported, somehow the size has changed, so we need to
   modify the project for the box outlines.
   * Select the newly imported object (box outline)
   * F2 to open Properties window.
   * In Properties window, X,Y,Z section, Geometry block, set X-pos to
     80.000 mm, Y-Pos to 60.000 mm, Width to 745.000 mm, Height to
     564.000 mm.
   * Close Properties window. File -> Save As..., save file as
     box_artwork_base.sla.

--- m1_bottom_mac_address.sla

The MAC address label is meant to be glued right below the product
label on the bottom of of each Milkymist One. It should have the
same width as the product label.
This is a separate label to go with the copyleft hardware philosophy
that all serial numbers should be documented and easily removable.
By making it a separate label, it is removable without also having
to remove the product label.

** open m1_bottom_mac_address.sla with Scribus
** File -> Export -> Save as PDF...
    Save

part of the label is wrapped around the DC cable, the rest is glued
back to back forming a flag.
