\section{Quick start guide}
Just follow those four super-easy steps to get started with Milkymist One generated visuals in no time.

\subsection{Connect the power supply}
Use the provided 5V supply adapter to power the Milkymist One. \textbf{Do not use the 12V adapter} which is for the camera.

\subsection{Connect the video projector}
Connect a VGA video projector (or a simple screen) to the video output of the Milkymist One.

\subsection{Connect the camera}
Using the provided cable, connect the RCA jack of the camera to the \textbf{green} RCA jack of the Milkymist One. \textit{The other two RCA jacks are used for S-Video and component (RGB) video sources, and not for audio.}

Use the provided 12V supply adapter to power the camera. \textbf{Do not use the 5V adapter} which is for the Milkymist One.

For the best visual results, use a black background and proper lighting.

\subsection{Enjoy}
Press the middle pushbutton on the Milkymist One to start.

After a dozen seconds, the effects start appearing on the projector.

Some effects use the image captured from the camera, while some others do not and are purely generative. Similarly, some effects are reactive to sound, which can be picked up from the internal microphone or fed using the line input jack. Have fun!

When you want to turn off the Milkymist One, hold the middle pushbutton for a few seconds.
